# Copilot Code Review Instructions

## Repository Context

This repository is a browser-based ROS1/ROS2 bag file analyzer built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.
File parsing and data processing run fully client-side in the browser. Node.js is used mainly for build, test, and tooling.

Before reviewing a change, first confirm which area it affects:

- Frontend UI and interaction flow
- Client-side data processing and parsing
- Build, test, or tooling configuration

Key areas to understand before commenting:

- `src/App.tsx` - Main UI flow, upload handling, filters, exports, tabs, and diagnostics interactions
- `src/rosbagUtils.ts` - ROS bag loading, filtering, export logic, and browser-side processing
- `src/mcapUtils.ts` - MCAP parsing and message extraction
- `src/reindexUtils.ts` - Reindexing for unindexed or damaged ROS1 bag files
- `src/types.ts` - Shared types and severity mappings
- `e2e/*.spec.ts` - Browser-level behavior and integration coverage

## Review Approach

Prioritize findings that indicate:

- User-facing frontend regressions
- Incorrect parsing, filtering, export, or diagnostics behavior
- Missing or mismatched tests for changed behavior
- Unsafe TypeScript or error-handling patterns
- Dependency or runtime-boundary mistakes

Do not start from general Node.js advice. First verify the runtime boundary, the existing implementation style, and the library APIs already used in this codebase.

## Frontend Review Priorities

Frontend changes should receive extra scrutiny. Focus on:

- Upload flow regressions, including loading state, success state, and error state
- Filter UI correctness for rosout and diagnostics views
- Export UI behavior and filename/type correctness
- Diagnostics tab behavior, row expansion, and state transitions
- Reindex notice and download flow for unindexed bag files
- Accessibility for buttons, file inputs, tabs, toggles, and icon-only controls
- Hook rules and `useEffect` dependency correctness
- State updates that can drift out of sync with visible UI

Flag React performance issues only when there is a concrete render-time cost or a clear unnecessary re-render problem. Do not recommend `useMemo` or `useCallback` by default.

## Data Processing and Node.js / TypeScript Guidance

Data-processing logic is a high-priority review area, but do not assume the implementation should follow generic server-side Node.js patterns.

When reviewing parsing or export logic:

- Confirm whether the code runs in the browser, not just whether it is written in TypeScript
- Check for type safety, null safety, and explicit error handling
- Verify dependency placement: browser runtime dependencies belong in `dependencies`; build and test tools belong in `devDependencies`
- Prefer `async/await` for Promise-based APIs
- Do not flag callback-style code when it is required by an existing library API, such as ROS bag reader callbacks

Logic correctness to verify:

- ROS1 severity mapping: `1=DEBUG`, `2=INFO`, `4=WARN`, `8=ERROR`, `16=FATAL`
- ROS2 severity mapping: `10=DEBUG`, `20=INFO`, `30=WARN`, `40=ERROR`, `50=FATAL`
- Diagnostics mapping: `0=OK`, `1=WARN`, `2=ERROR`, `3=STALE`
- Filter logic preserves documented OR/AND behavior
- CSV/JSON/TXT/Parquet exports faithfully reflect filtered data
- Parsing remains fully local and does not introduce network-based processing
- Large-file handling does not introduce obvious new main-thread blocking behavior

## Test Expectations by Change Type

Do not require a single test style for all changes. First classify the change.

- Pure filtering, transform, or deterministic export logic changes should usually add or update Vitest coverage in `src/rosbagUtils.test.ts`
- Browser interaction, upload/download flow, parsing integration, MCAP behavior, reindex behavior, and UI-driven export behavior may be validated with Playwright E2E tests under `e2e/*.spec.ts`
- If behavior changes and neither unit tests nor E2E coverage change, flag the missing coverage
- Do not reject a change only because the test was added in E2E instead of unit test when E2E is the correct layer

## Validation Commands

Use these as the baseline validation commands:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run build
```

If a change touches upload flow, parsing, export behavior, diagnostics interactions, reindex behavior, or other browser-level workflows, also consider:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Flag changes that are likely to break these commands or invalidate the covered behavior.

## What Not to Flag

Do not flag the following unless there is a concrete correctness or maintainability issue:

- Valid callback-based use of existing parsing library APIs
- Missing unit tests when the behavior is already appropriately covered by E2E
- Pure style issues already handled by ESLint or formatting tools
- Minor naming preferences that do not affect behavior
- Speculative frontend performance concerns without evidence
- Generic Node.js guidance that ignores the browser runtime of this app
